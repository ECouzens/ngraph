Installation
************

To install |geon|, you must first install our neon in a virtual environment. For neon install instructions, see: http://neon.nervanasys.com/.

Activate the neon virtualenv with ``. .venv/bin/activate`` and then run::

    git clone git@github.com:NervanaSystems/ngraph.git
    cd ngraph
    make install

Getting Started
===============

Several jupyter notebook walk-throughs demonstrate how to use Nervana Graph:

* ``ngraph/examples/walk_through/`` guides developers through implementing logistic regression with ngraph
* ``ngraph/examples/mnist/MNIST_Direct.ipynb`` demonstrates building a deep learning model using ngraph directly.

The neon frontend can also be used to define and train deep learning models:

* ``ngraph/examples/mnist/mnist_mlp.py``: Multi-layer perceptron network on MNIST dataset.
* ``ngraph/examples/cifar10/cifar10_conv.py``: Convolutional neural network on CIFAR-10.
* ``ngraph/examples/cifar10/cifar10_mlp.py``: Multi-layer perceptron on CIFAR-10 dataset.
* ``ngraph/examples/ptb/char_rnn.py``: Character-level RNN model on Penn Treebank data.

We also include examples for using tensorflow to define graphs that are then passed to ngraph for execution:

* ``ngraph/frontends/tensorflow/examples/minimal.py``
* ``ngraph/frontends/tensorflow/examples/logistic_regression.py``
* ``ngraph/frontends/tensorflow/examples/mnist_mlp.py``


Developer Guidelines
====================

Before checking in code, run the unit tests and check for style errors::

    make test
    make style

Documentation can be generated via::

    make doc

And viewed at ``doc/build/html/index.html``.
