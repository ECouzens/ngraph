# How to use the graph rewrite pass
#
# Graph rewrite pass essentially allows pass users to rewrite parts of the
# input graph in any way they want. Fusion is one example of graph rewrite that
# fuses multiple ops together. At a high-level users of the pass need to
# specify 2 things: 1) which ops to fuse, and 2) how to create new op(s) from
# the existing ops.
#
# In order to specify which ops to rewrite, users specify a 'pattern'. A
# pattern, in very basic terms, is a sub-graph that is to be rewritten. These
# patterns are constructed using the same ngraph APIs used in constructing
# actual graphs.  E.g., to construct Add op, use ng.Add(). Since the new op is
# most likely going to be constructed using some of the rewritten ops, the
# graph rewrite pass allows users to refer to the parts of the sub-graph by
# providing 'label' op (This is an op called PatternLabelOp in op_graph.) Label
# op follows the notion of binding variables to terms from functional
# languages.
#
# To give an example of a label usage, assume that we want to fuse addition of
# Conv2D and Bias into a single Conv2DWithBias op. Conv2DWithBias op will use
# same inputs as Conv2D op and Bias op, so we need to refer to the inputs of
# Conv2D op and Bias op to construct the fused op. In order to refer to the
# inputs, we would use labels. Essentially, the rule for fusion would
# conceptually look like: Add(Conv2D(X, Y), Bias(Z)) = Conv2DWithBias(X, Y, Z).
# Here X, Y, and Z are labels.
#
# A complication that often arises in ngraph's pattern matching is the presence
# of unanticipated ops such as BroadCast.  These ops are not expected by the
# user, but they are inserted in the graph to for certain operations, such as
# adjust axes as an example. To accommodate such ops, the graph rewrite pass
# provides PatternSkipOp, which is an op to specify to the pass that if such
# unanticipated op is found in the place of a PatternSkipOp, then skip the
# pattern match for it. The ops to be skipped are specified by the user by
# defining a predicate that holds true for ops to be skipped.
#
# Once the patterns are written, a user registers them with the graph rewrite
# pass using GraphRewritePass.register_pattern API. register_pattern API takes
# 2 inputs: a pattern that is to be searched in the graph, and the callback
# function to be invoked when the pattern matches. The callback function is the
# place where user would implement logic for rewriting sub-graphs. The callback
# function aptly gets label map and the matched op as inputs. The label map is
# simply a map of all the labels used in the pattern and the ops in the
# sub-graph that they map to. In the above example, if actual graph contained
# Add(Conv2D({1}, {2}), Bias({3})), then the label map would contain X={1},
# Y={2}, Z={3}. For examples of using API and label, refer to cpufusion.py that
# uses rewrite pass to implement fusion for forward and backward ReLU
# operation.
#
# Rewrite pass works as follows: 1) a user creates and registers all
# required<pattern, callback function> with the rewrite pass in the pass init
# routine, 2) when do_pass for the rewrite pass is invoked, it goes over the
# complete graph looking for matches for all the registered patterns, and for
# the matching patterns invokes their callback functions. This is a standard
# design borrowed from numerous places such as a specification of yacc rules
# (grammar rules).
#
# The reason for using this design is: since all patterns are known to the
# rewrite pass beforehand, it can scan whole graph only once, and match all the
# patterns.  An optimization that we have not yet implemented (we may not
# implement that for now since the number of patterns is too small) is
# constructing an FSA (automata) from all the patterns. Automata will ensure
# the fastest possible match for the patterns.  Even without automata, this
# design allows us to do such optimizations in the future.
#
#
# A word on ordering of the patterns: The order in which patterns are
# registered to the rewrite pass is the order in which the pass looks for their
# match. In other words, if the patterns match same sub-graph then the callback
# function of the one registered first would be invoked first. Also, it is not
# necessary that the callback functions must do the replacement -- it can
# simply be a debug pattern matching rule that prints the matching sub-graphs.
