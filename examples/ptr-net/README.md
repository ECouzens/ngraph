- reference paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03134.pdf

## How to run
1. Download TSP dataset `tsp_5_train.zip` and `tsp_10_train.zip` from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2fg8yPGn2TCMzBtS0o4Q2RJaEU)
2. Unzip `tsp_5_train.zip` and `tsp_10_train.zip`
```
$ unzip '*.zip'
```
3. Run training script
```
$ python train.py --train_file tsp5.txt --test_file tsp5_test.txt
```
## Results
- prelim results on tsp5.txt

- prelim results on tsp10.txt

## To-dos
- [] ptr-net inference code
- [] ptr-net convergence issue (compare to [TF implementation](https://github.com/devsisters/pointer-network-tensorflow))
- [] add LSTM to rnn cell selection
- [] visualize TSP
